# Healthcare-analytic
 The process of building a comprehensive healthcare analytics system involves several distinct phases, from the initial survey of business processes to the development of dashboards that provide actionable insights. Below, I detail each phase involved in developing an effective healthcare analytics solution:

## 1. Survey
### Business Process
Understanding the specific business processes within healthcare organizations is crucial. This involves mapping out patient care workflows, administrative operations, and financial processes to identify data capture and reporting needs.

### Business Canvas Model
The Business Canvas Model helps define the value propositions, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key activities, key resources, key partners, and cost structure of the healthcare system.

### Data Flow
Mapping the data flow involves understanding how data moves through various systems and processes in the healthcare organization, from patient registration to treatment and billing.

### Requirements
Requirements gathering is critical and involves collecting detailed needs from stakeholders to ensure the analytics system addresses all functional, technical, user, and regulatory requirements.

### Data Scaling System
Designing a system that can scale according to the data volume, variety, and velocity that healthcare systems typically handle. This includes planning for data growth and the incorporation of new data sources.

### ERD OLTP
Creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases to define how data elements interact with each other in transactional systems.

## 2. Analysis and Design
### Data Exploration
Data exploration involves using statistical methods and visualization tools to understand the characteristics and uncover patterns within the data. This stage sets the groundwork for more detailed analysis and model building.

### Data Warehouse Architecture
This step involves designing the architecture of the data warehouse, including how data will be stored, retrieved, and managed.

### ETL Process
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is the core component in building a data warehouse:

- Load to Staging: Data from various sources are extracted and loaded into a staging area where data is cleansed and consolidated.
- Load to Warehouse: After staging, the cleaned data is transformed as per the business logic and loaded into the data warehouse.
### Data Warehouse
The final structure of the data warehouse, optimized for analysis and querying rather than transaction processing, allowing for complex queries and data analysis without affecting the performance of the primary transaction systems.

## 3.Dashboard Development
Developing dashboards is about creating visual representations of the data analytics to provide actionable insights easily understandable by stakeholders. These dashboards should:

- Display key metrics that are relevant to the stakeholders' operational, tactical, and strategic needs.
- Be user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to drill down into the data for deeper analysis.
- Provide real-time updates where necessary to enable timely decision-making.
  
In summary, building a healthcare analytics system requires thorough planning and understanding of both the healthcare operations and the data lifecycle. This involves meticulous design and strategic execution to ensure that the analytics system is robust, scalable, and delivers meaningful insights that can significantly enhance the quality of care and operational efficiencies within healthcare organizations.
